so the characters choose what universe to start of in and a class and race to match. no matter what universe they are in they become targeted by the reforgers after a event of their choice. They run into some that recognise them and get into a fight but run away they see a mostrosity made up of the millenium falcon with a tardis strapped to the top and space marine drop pods on the sides and the subtle knife on the front. it lands and a seemingly normal human from real life walks out. They pull out a double bladed lightsaber and gracefully incapacitate the reforgers and then useing psykic powers tell them to walk away and forget this encounter. the human (who is the physical in universe representation of the dm) brings them on board the millenium falcon and tell them the deal with the reforgers. he then lands on an other universe (his dark materials) in svalbard. he tells them that theres a place near here and that the should show a shard of the subtle knife to allow them to pass. he gives them the shard. he then proccedes to remove his modifications and tells the players its theirs now. the players find the (iorek's) palace and decide to enter for shelter but the guards arrest them and take them to the throne room. iorek asks why they are here. if they take out the shard and show them he lets them go free around his palace. if they procrastonate and refuse to answer things get violent (there are 4 guards plus iorek). if they can also simply leave if they forget about the shard.
after this it is mostly free play
