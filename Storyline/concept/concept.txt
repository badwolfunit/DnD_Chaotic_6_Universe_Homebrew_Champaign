THE CONCEPT


The Four Crowns—Lucifer, Satan, Leviathan, and Belial—are scattered across universes, each infecting the reality they landed in. These universes are bleeding, corrupted, or twisting slowly into new hells.


Your party is a ragtag band drawn together by prophecy, fate, or manipulation—sent by a dying god, a rogue angel, or maybe even a fifth, unknown Crown. Their quest? Stop the Crowns from being reunited.


If even two are joined, reality begins to unravel.

THE MULTIVERSE STRUCTURE


Think of each arc as a “season” in a multiversal saga:

    Arc I: The Lucent Lies of Lucifer

    Universe: A false utopia ruled by a radiant AI-god who turns knowledge into weaponized light. Philosophers are hunted. Books whisper madness. The Crown of Lucifer rests at the core of a blinding white star.

    Theme: Illusion of perfection. Mind vs truth. Betrayal by beauty.

    Arc II: The Chains of Satan

    Universe: A grimdark dystopia locked in an eternal war. All citizens are judged from birth. The Iron Crown of Satan lies in a fortress-court atop a floating city held aloft by judicial verdicts.

    Theme: Rebellion vs control. Who deserves power? What is justice?

    Arc III: The Drowning Dream of Leviathan

    Universe: A crumbling ocean-world flooded by nightmares. Time doesn’t work right. Fish sing. Thoughts become tides. The Crown of Leviathan lies in the belly of a god-whale.

    Theme: Insanity, emotion, fluidity of self. Who are you when memory drowns?

    Arc IV: The Feast of Belial

    Universe: A planet-wide banquet, endless and grotesque. Nobles cannibalize each other with perfect manners. The poor turn to gold and rot. The Crown of Belial is baked into a living god-king’s chest.

    Theme: Pleasure, corruption, decay of truth beneath luxury.

MAIN VILLAIN FACTION: THE REFORGERS


A secret society of planar warlocks, fallen angels, liches, and cultists. They believe uniting the Four Crowns will restore “balance” by remaking the universe in the Devil’s image. They call it The Harmonization.


You could give them a creepy, clinical tone—like they think they’re helping. Not evil—just devoted to ending chaos by becoming it.

FINAL ARC: THE BROKEN THRONE


Once all four arcs are done, the party must travel to the center of the multiverse—an ancient plane of ruin where the Devil’s soul lies sealed. If the Reforgers beat them there, they’ll reforge the Broken God.


The players may have to:

    Destroy the crowns (at great cost),

    Wield them, risking corruption,

    Or become the new Thrones and bind the Devil within themselves.

MECHANICAL TWISTS

    Planar Keys: Special artifacts that let players shift between universes. Maybe each Prince corrupted a “key.”

    Corruption Points: The closer you get to the Crowns, the more tainted you become. Gain powers… at a cost.

    Devil’s Bargains: Every plane offers deals. Want the truth? Pay in memories. Want power? Trade a party member’s name. Nothing’s free.

    The Infernal Hierarchy


    The Four Princes—Lucifer, Satan, Leviathan, Belial—are not merely lords. Together, they are the Devil. They are not allies. They are rivals, fragments of a broken whole that hate each other as much as they crave unity.


    Each Prince rules with a distinct philosophy and force:

        Lucifer – The Mind That Burns

            Domain: Light, knowledge, beauty, arrogance

            Appearance: A radiant, six-winged figure with eyes that blind and enlighten

            Followers: Philosophers turned mad, light-wielding heretics, mirror-demons

        Satan – The Adversary Eternal

            Domain: Law, rebellion, judgment

            Appearance: A burning judge with a serpent’s tongue and a gavel that is also a sword

            Followers: Oath-twisting paladins, tyrant-judges, chains made flesh

        Leviathan – The Abyss That Devours

            Domain: Emotion, chaos, depth, memory

            Appearance: An ever-shifting sea beast with a thousand weeping faces

            Followers: Dream-priests, soul-drowned prophets, tidal horrors

        Belial – The Flesh That Crawls

            Domain: Desire, rot, lies, pleasure

            Appearance: A golden idol of beauty on the outside, festering and alive within

            Followers: Glutton-priests, parasite nobles, decadent cannibals

    Below the Princes: The Greater and Lesser Demons


    The Eight Sub-Princes, often depicted in infernal texts like The Book of Abramelin, serve the Crowns in various twisted capacities. These include:

        Astaroth – Keeper of forbidden secrets

        Beelzebub – Lord of decay and pestilence

        Asmodee – Architect of lust and passion

        Paimon, Amaymon, Magoth, Oriens, Ariton – Each commanding legions, each with their own cults, roles, and rivalries

    These Sub-Princes act as generals, tempters, and administrators of the Infernal Realms. Each one rules legions of lesser demons, many of whom are fallen angels—remnants of the same divine war that shattered the Devil.
